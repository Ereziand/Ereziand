- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew, a professional teacher and now the Head Technical at International Unity School, Edjeba - (Owned by Shell Staff Edu- Coop Warri- Nigeria).
- I can provide all the necesary details on what is required to provide student report card or result sheets especcially elementary and secondary schools. I have always had issues with many programmers to meet this need probably the requisite knowledge is lacking when building a school management solution. 
 - ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating students report card or result and ready to collaborate with one that is ready to meet this need. I am not a programmer and not a coder, but have the knowledge of what is involved. 
- Currently i can use excel to do that but i need a system that can give me all the features and an intergarted platform to work with a community of users; parents, bursary, staff, students, employers.
